This is the official implementation of _"ReinFlow: Fine-tuning Flow Matching Policy with Online Reinforcement Learning"_.  

If you like our work, we'll be happy if you give us a star **:star:**!

## 🚀 About ReinFlow


**ReinFlow** is a flexible **policy gradient framework** for fine-tuning **flow matching policies** at **any denoising step**.

How does it work?  
👉 First, train flow policies using **imitation learning** (behavior cloning).  
👉 Then, fine-tune them with **online reinforcement learning** using ReinFlow!

🧩 **Supports**:
- ✅ 1-Rectified Flow  
- ✅ Shortcut Models  
- ✅ Any other policy defined by ODEs (in principle)

📈 **Empirical Results**: ReinFlow achieves strong performance across a variety of robotic tasks:
- 🦵 Legged Locomotion (OpenAI Gym)  
- ✋ State-based manipulation (Franka Kitchen)  
- 👀 Visual manipulation (Robomimic)

🧠 **Key Innovation**: ReinFlow trains a **noise injection network** end-to-end:
- ✅ Makes policy probabilities tractable, even with **very few denoising steps** (e.g., 4, 2, or 1)  
- ✅ Robust to discretization and Monte Carlo approximation errors
